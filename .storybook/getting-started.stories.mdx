# Getting Started

## Install

The package is available on [Cisco's Artifactory package registry](https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/webapp/#/home). See information below about [accessing Artifactory](#getting-access-to-artifactory).

```
  npm install @cisco-ats/atomic-react
```

If you're implementing a library, place the package entry in the `peerDependencies` section of your `package.json`.

## Content Security Policy

If your website has a content security policy, in order for the fonts to load an entry will need added:

`font-src https://cdn.security.cisco.com`

## Getting Access to Artifactory

(borrowed from [threatgrid/ats-integrations/README](https://github.com/threatgrid/ats-integrations))

Use the artifactory instance at https://devhub.cisco.com/

Devhub is the DMZ-hosted partial mirror of the internal npm repository [engci-maven](http://engci-maven.cisco.com).

Submit the [request access form](https://engit.cisco.com/ci/#/request/question) with the following information:

- **Service Offering:** DevHub
- **Category:** Additional Access
- **DevHub Team Name/Repository:** cisco-threat-response-npm - https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/cisco-threat-response-npm/

Upon successful access to the repo, login to devhub (generate/retrieve your API key from your devhub profile):

```
npm login --registry=https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/api/npm/cisco-threat-response-npm/ --scope=@cisco-ats
Username: <YOUR_CISCO_USERNAME>
Password: <YOUR_DEVHUB_API_KEY>
```

Afterwards, your `~/.npmrc` file will look something like:

```
@cisco-ats:registry=https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/api/npm/cisco-threat-response-npm/
//devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/api/npm/cisco-threat-response-npm/:_authToken=XXXxSOMExBIGxJWTxXXX
```
