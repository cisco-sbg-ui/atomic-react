## Accessibility Notes

By default, `ADivider` components are assigned the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) role of [separator](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#separator) which denotes that the divider "separates and distinguishes sections of content or groups of menuitems." However, sometimes a divider is just a way to make an interface look nice. In those cases, the role of `presentation` should be used which denotes "an element whose implicit native role semantics will not be mapped to the accessibility API." To override the default separator role in an `ADivider`, simply add a `role="presentation"` prop to your component.
