# Getting Started

## Install

The package is available on [Cisco's Artifactory package registry](https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/webapp/#/home). See information below about [accessing Artifactory](#getting-access-to-artifactory).

```
  npm install @cisco-ats/atomic-react
```

If you're implementing a library, place the package entry in the `peerDependencies` section of your `package.json`.

<br />

### Content Security Policy

If your website has a content security policy, in order for the fonts to load an entry will need to be added:

`font-src https://cdn.security.cisco.com`

<br />

## Integrating

At this point, you can start importing components (e.g. `import AButton from "@cisco-ats/atomic-react/AButton"`) and using them.
Alternatively, integrating the atomic-react `lib` with your build will give you control over the sass and automatically import the components you use for you. [`create-react-app` users can also use the atomic-react `lib`](#integration-with-create-react-app-cra).

<br />

### Add the Babel Preset

The Babel preset **automatically imports** components. Add the following to your Babel configuration:

```diff
{
  "presets": [
    "@babel/preset-env",
    "@babel/preset-react",
+    "@cisco-ats/atomic-react/babel-preset"
  ]
}
```

### ESLint plugin

Without import statements, ESLint will complain about your source code. The atomic-react ESLint plugin will take care of that. First install the ESLint plugin:

```
npm i -D @cisco-ats/eslint-plugin-atomic-react
```

Then add the following to your ESLint configuration:

```diff
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
+    "plugin:@cisco-ats/eslint-config-atomic-react/recommended"
  ],
  ...
}
```

### Support (Dart) Sass

The `lib` build gives you control over the sass, so you'll need to support it if you don't. First install:

```
# Webpack
npm i -D sass sass-loader css-loader style-loader
# Rollup
npm i -D sass rollup-plugin-postcss
```

For webpack, add to your config:

```diff
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      ...,
+      {
+        test: /\.s(a|c)ss$/,
+        use: [
+          "style-loader",
+          "css-loader",
+          {
+            loader: "sass-loader",
+            options: {
+              implementation: require("sass"),
+            },
+          },
+        ],
+      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Or for Rollup, add to your config:

```diff
+import postcss from "rollup-plugin-postcss";

const config = {
  plugins: [
    ...,
+    postcss()
  ]
};

export default config;
```

## Integration with `create-react-app` (CRA)

You can use the atomic-react `lib` with auto-import and sass support in `create-react-app` applications as well.

Start by installing the libraries necessary to modify the CRA build and support sass:

```
npm i -D customize-cra react-app-rewired sass @cisco-ats/eslint-plugin-atomic-react
```

Add a `config-overrides.js` file to the root of your directory:

```
const {override, addBabelPreset} = require("customize-cra");

module.exports = override(
  addBabelPreset("@cisco-ats/atomic-react/babel-preset")
);
```

Make adjustments to your `package.json`:

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
-    "start": "react-scripts start",
+    "start": "react-app-rewired start",
-    "build": "react-scripts build",
+    "build": "react-app-rewired build",
-    "test": "react-scripts test",
+    "test": "react-app-rewired test",
  },
  ...
}
```

Add the ESLint plugin to your ESLint config:

```diff
{
-  "extends": ["react-app"],
+  "extends": ["react-app", "@cisco-ats/eslint-config-atomic-react"],
  ...
}
```

## Getting Access to Artifactory

(borrowed from [threatgrid/ats-integrations/README](https://github.com/threatgrid/ats-integrations))

Use the artifactory instance at https://devhub.cisco.com/

Devhub is the DMZ-hosted partial mirror of the internal npm repository [engci-maven](http://engci-maven.cisco.com).

Submit the [request access form](https://engit.cisco.com/ci/#/request/question) with the following information:

- **Service Offering:** DevHub
- **Category:** Additional Access
- **DevHub Team Name/Repository:** cisco-threat-response-npm - https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/cisco-threat-response-npm/

Upon successful access to the repo, login to devhub (generate/retrieve your API key from your devhub profile):

```
npm login --registry=https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/api/npm/cisco-threat-response-npm/ --scope=@cisco-ats
Username: <YOUR_CISCO_USERNAME>
Password: <YOUR_DEVHUB_API_KEY>
```

Afterwards, your `~/.npmrc` file will look something like:

```
@cisco-ats:registry=https://devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/api/npm/cisco-threat-response-npm/
//devhub.cisco.com/artifactory/api/npm/cisco-threat-response-npm/:_authToken=XXXxSOMExBIGxJWTxXXX
```
